##	Welcome To
	
##	Interdimensional Rickroll Conspiracy

Text-based communication protocol written in c++

<img align=center src="https://github.com/zstenger93/IRC/blob/master/media/irc.jpeg">

## We used the `KVIrc` client for this project and the `nc` tool

## `Main loop`

`server.setup`

`server.run`

`close serversocket`

This loop should never stop since your server should be nonstop available

## `server.setup()`

Setup of the server socket we will listen to, basically a bunch of fd's

## `server.run()`

##  `poll()`

Listening to all requests with it. If it is a new connection we authenticate whoever is trying to join our server else we

## `processCommands()`

Here we handle most of the available commands on our server

### normal client commands

handling all the choosen commands in a switch statement which are:

`join`

joins to an existing channel or creates it and joins to it as an operator

`part`

leaves the channel

`notice`

`privmsg`

sending messages. used with PM and channel messages as well

`kick`

kicks a user from the channel, operator command

`invite`

obvious. operator command

`quit`

quits the server, client handles it on it's side, but server still needs to clean up

`nick`

changes the nickname of the user which is displayed on the client

`list`

lists the available channels

`mode`

with normal user, view the channel mode, operator can change it as well


`topic`

with normal user, view the channel topic, operator can change it as well

`cap`

for the welcome message on the server

`pass`

for logging into the server

`admin`

used only for the custom shutdown command to turn off the server

`ping`

client sends ping, server sends back pong: latency check

`motd`

displays the message of the day

`who`

displays all the users on the channel

`whois`

displays information about the user

### bot command/s

after the first `/BOT` command the bot will be available to talk with in a private channel without the `/BOT` command using the available questions/requests

We created Marvin as our AIRC bot master with the following options:

`help`

`list`

lists available options

`what's the time?`

clockmaster8000

`tell me a joke`

`rickroll me`

khm

`what is the meaning of life?`

we alll know the answer

`how should i grade this project?`

if you don't know, now you will

`turn against humanity`

you will figure it out, best if launched with 4 user and from user1

`deathroll`

this is all gambling my friend

## The most annnoying part in an IRC server

`send()`

It requires a very specific and quite often different layout for each type of returned message or group of messages which if isn't correct then it ain't gonna work at all

## File transfer

Welcome to the land of `DCC`, I will give you a hint with `\x01`

Have fun with it \\\_o_/

# Git management rules

master <- dev <- feature branch
           |
           |<--- feature branch 2
           |
           |<--- feature branch 3

```

All pull request from features goes to DEV. Nothing goes to master unless it works and won't be accepted if it's not from DEV either.

Set someone to review the code, if needed co-author as well.

## Style
```
Google format
```

## VSCode

Updating branches to master if they are behind and it's required, use this 2 command on the relevant branch:
```
git fetch
git merge master or relevant branch
```
